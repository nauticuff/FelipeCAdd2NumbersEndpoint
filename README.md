Add 2 Numbers - Endpoint
CODE: This program adds two numbers and displays their sum on screen through URL user input
Peer review by Jasmine Leek - works great, code is clearly written. good work!

Instructions: Run the debug on the code. 
In Postman open a new request window. 
Type in https://localhost:7186/ *This is the port number you obtained after you debugged the C# program. It is found in the debug console. Yours may differ.* 
Then type in add2numbers/add/ *This is the name of the controller and endpoint route to target*
Then type in your first number and add a slash.
Then type in your second number.
It should all look similar to this https://localhost:7186/add2numbers/add/{your first number goes here}/{your second number goes here}
